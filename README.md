# So_long

This is the fifth project of √©cole 42 projects.<br>
This project is a very small 2D game. It is built to make you work with textures, sprites. And some very basic gameplay elements.

## üóíÔ∏è About

The game is simple, you are santa and needs to collect all the presents to finally go down in the fireplace. But be careful, because Rudolph doesn't want to work this Christmas, so don't touch him!

## Run

This program use the **minilibx** library. A very specific library developed for 42 projects.<br>

### Installing minilibx

The official repository:
[https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux]https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux

Follow the installing process steps to install the library on your machine. Otherwise the project won't run.

### Running the program

First clone the repository into your machine
```
https://github.com/gabrielasertori/So_long-42.git
```

Then, build the program with make or make bonus<br>
Obs.: standart project doesn't has enemies, only the bonus part. If you want to run the program with enemies, please, pass bonus as argument to make.
```
make bonus
```

After, you'll need to execute the binary with the path to the map
```
./so_long_bonus maps/map3_bonus.ber
```
Maps are in the maps directory.<br>
Bonus maps works weird with no bonus binary, but bonus binary works fine with any kind of map.<br>

## Make your own game!

You can build any map following the rules:
- The file must be a .ber file
- `1` represents walls and the map must be sowrounded by them
- `0` represents valid paths
- `P` represents the player starting position
- `C` represents the collectables
- `E` represents the exit
- `Y` represents the enemies positions (only with bonus)
- It must contains at least: 1 player, 1 collectables and 1 exit
